    "\n",
    "Splitting the data: The original dataset is randomly divided into K equal-sized subsets or folds.\n",

    "Performance evaluation: The performance metric, such as accuracy or mean squared error, is calculated for each iteration. The results from all K iterations are then averaged to obtain a single performance score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection and tuning: K-fold cross-validation helps in comparing and selecting the best model among different algorithms or hyperparameter configurations. It provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance by considering multiple variations of the training and testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variations of K-fold cross-validation: There are variations of K-fold cross-validation, such as stratified K-fold cross-validation, which ensures that the distribution of class labels is maintained in each fold. Another variation is repeated K-fold cross-validation, where the process is repeated multiple times with different random splits of the data to further improve reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-fold cross-validation helps in mitigating issues like overfitting and underfitting by providing a more accurate estimate of a model's performance on unseen data. It allows for better generalization and helps in making more informed decisions regarding model selection and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
